# 🌾 Crop Recommendation Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Type Definitions** (`types/crop.ts`)
Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for:
- `Crop`: Complete crop data structure with growing conditions, planting info, care instructions, and harvest details
- `WeatherAnalysis`: Weather metrics summary
- `CropRecommendation`: Individual crop recommendation with suitability score
- `CropRecommendationResponse`: Complete API response structure

### 2. **Crop Service** (`services/cropService.ts`)
Implemented AI-powered crop recommendation service with:
- **`analyzeWeatherData()`**: Analyzes 7-day weather forecast
  - Calculates average temperature
  - Totals rainfall
  - Determines general conditions
- **`getCropRecommendations()`**: Uses Gemini AI to generate 4 crop recommendations
  - Processes weather data
  - Generates context-aware prompts
  - Returns structured JSON responses
- **`getCropDetails()`**: Fetches detailed information for specific crops

### 3. **Crops Screen** (`screens/CropsScreen.tsx`)
Main recommendation interface featuring:
- **Weather Integration**: Auto-fetches location-based weather data
- **AI Recommendations**: Displays 4 recommended crops with scores
- **Interactive Cards**: Each crop shows:
  - Icon and name

### 5. **Navigation Setup** (`navigation/CropsNavigator.tsx`)
Created stack navigator for:
- CropsList screen (main recommendations)
- CropDetail screen (detailed view)
- Integrated into main app tabs

### 6. **App Integration** (`App.tsx`)
- Replaced simple CropsScreen with CropsNavigator
- Enables navigation between list and detail views
