# Firebase Authentication Installation Guide

To complete the Firebase authentication setup, you'll need to install the Firebase SDK and AsyncStorage.

## Install Dependencies
Run these commands in your project directory:

```bash
npm install firebase
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

## Dependencies Status
✅ Firebase SDK - Installed (v12.2.1)
✅ AsyncStorage - Installed (v1.24.0)

## Authentication Features Implemented:

1. **Firebase Configuration** - Located in `config/firebase.ts`
   - ✅ AsyncStorage persistence configured for React Native
   - ✅ Handles app reinitialization gracefully
2. **Authentication Context** - Located in `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` 
3. **Updated AuthScreen** - Full Firebase integration with error handling
4. **Updated App.tsx** - Proper authentication flow management
5. **Updated ProfileScreen** - Logout functionality and user profile display

## How to Use:

1. ✅ Dependencies are installed
2. ✅ The app handles authentication state automatically
3. ✅ Users can sign up, sign in, and logout
4. ✅ Authentication state persists across app restarts with AsyncStorage
5. ✅ Profile screen displays user information and logout option

## Features:
- ✅ Email/password authentication
- ✅ User registration with display name
- ✅ Password reset functionality ("Forgot Password")
- ✅ Proper error handling for common Firebase auth errors
- ✅ Loading states during authentication
- ✅ Automatic redirect to main app when authenticated
- ✅ Logout functionality
- ✅ Persistent authentication with AsyncStorage

## Authentication Flow:
1. **New Users**: Welcome → Auth Screen → Sign Up → Main App
2. **Returning Users**: Welcome → Auth Screen → Sign In → Main App  
3. **Authenticated Users**: Welcome → Auto-login → Main App
4. **Password Reset**: Sign In → "Forgot Password" → Email sent
5. **Logout**: Profile → Logout → Auth Screen

The authentication system is now fully functional with Firebase and includes AsyncStorage persistence!
