# ✅ Forum Issues Fixed

## Issues That Were Fixed

### 1. ❌ Non-Serializable Navigation Warning
**Error**: 
```
Non-serializable values were found in the navigation state
params.post.updatedAt (Sun Oct 05 2025 17:16:56 GMT+0200)
```

**Cause**: Date objects can't be passed through React Navigation params

**Fix Applied**:
- Dates are now converted to ISO strings before navigation
- Dates are deserialized back to Date objects in PostDetailScreen
- ✅ No more navigation warnings

**Files Changed**:
- `screens/ForumScreen.tsx` - Serialize dates before passing to navigation
- `components/forum/PostDetailScreen.tsx` - Deserialize dates on receive

### 2. ❌ Firestore Index Missing
**Error**:
```
The query requires an index. You can create it here: [LINK]
```

**Cause**: Firestore needs indexes for complex queries (filter + sort)

**Fix Required**: 
You need to create the index in Firebase Console

**Quick Fix**:
1. **Click the link from the error** - It will auto-create the index
2. Or go to: Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Indexes
3. Create index for:
   - Collection: `replies`
   - Fields: `postId` (Ascending), `createdAt` (Ascending)
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for index to build
5. Refresh the app

**Files Created**:
- `FIRESTORE_INDEXES_GUIDE.md` - Complete guide on creating indexes
